# Data Structure Animations - Weiss

This is a collection of algorithm animations for a C++ Data Structures and Algorithms course
(developed for the web course offering of CS361 from Old Dominion University, Norfolk Virginia).

Most of the animated code is taken from Weiss,  Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis in C++ 4e, 2013, 
Pearson PH 013284737X 978-0132847377

This repository is a fork created when we switched to Weiss from an older textbook. Most of the code reflects the other
book, but we will be converting over to the Weiss code during summer 2014.

The animations are developed using the [AlgAE animation engine](https://github.com/sjzeil/AlgAE). AlgAE is 
currently distributed in source form only, so to prepare these demos, you will need to install and build AlgAE
first.
