<h1>Hashing with Separate Chaining</h1></center>

<p>
For purposes of illustration, this hash table uses a deliberately weak choice of hash functions. Strings are 
hashed by their length (e.g., "Davis" and "Smith" would each have a hash code of 5).  This will yield more (and more 
easily predictable) collisions than would be seen with a proper hash function.

<h2>1. Installing and Launching</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="@JAR@" target="_blank">Download</a> the <code>.jar</code>
    file for this animation and save it in any convenient directory on
    your PC.
  </li>
  <li>
    To run this animation, you will need the Java 8 Runtime
    Environment (JRE).  <a
    href="http://www.java.com/en/download/">Download and install</a>
    it if you don't have it already.
  </li>
  <li>
       In most operating systems. you should be able to launch the
       animation by double-clicking on the <code>.jar</code> file you
       downloaded in step 1.
       <ul>
         <li>
           If that does not work, open a command window,
           <code>cd</code> to the directory where you saved the
           <code>.jar</code> file, and try the command
           <p>
             <code>java -jar @JAR@</code>
           </p>
         </li>
       </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>2. Operating Instructions</h2>

<ul>
   <li>
     Select a desired algorithm from the <b>Algorithm</b> menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the speed control to slow down the animation if desired.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alternatively, use the pause button.
    <ul>
      <li>
        When execution pauses inside of an algorithm, press the "step" button to single-step through 
        the code or use the "play" button to resume continual execution.</li>
        </ul>
      </li> 
      <li><ul><li>
        If you find the display is too hopelessly tangled, you can use your mouse to
        drag the nodes to more appropriate positions whenever you are paused within a running algorithm.
      </li></ul></li>   
    </ul>
